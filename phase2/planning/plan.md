# Phase 2 Planning

## Phase 1 cleanup
- implement Transaction class to make calculation of cost and revenue cleaner (eliminates need to specifically track unnatural tap sequence charges separately from trip costs)
- implement Filterable interface to to simplify code that fetches events etc by matching day and month
- make StatisticsManager not static and maybe look for other places where static can be avoided
- implement Logger

## Phase 2 Set-up
- do barebones GUI framework setup
- set up some basic unit testing
